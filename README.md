# Compost.js: Minimal node demo project

This project shows how to reference Compost.js from a Node
project. To run the demos, clone this project, install 
dependencies and run the demos:

```
npm install
npm run start
```

After running these two commands, you will see the demos
hosted by WebPack dev server at http://localhost:8080.

You can now start experimenting by editting the demos in 
the `src/demos.js` file.
